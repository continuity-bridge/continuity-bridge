# Tangent Parking Lot

This file is used by the "Focus Shepherd" to capture interesting tangents, ideas, and side-quests that arise during our sessions without derailing the primary task.

## 🚦 Priority Levels
- **🔴 IMPORTANT:** High-priority tangents requiring a dedicated future session (e.g., architectural shifts, personal revelations).
- **🟡 STANDARD:** Interesting ideas to explore when a task completes or during a weekly review.
- **🟢 MINOR:** Simple thoughts or optimizations to keep in mind.

## 📝 Active Tangents
*No active tangents. Focus is current.*
