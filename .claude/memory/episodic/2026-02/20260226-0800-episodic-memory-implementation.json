  "summary": "Reviewed Gemini's elaborate consciousness simulation proposal, designed lean episodic memory alternative",
  
  "salience": 0.85,
  "salience_reason": "Significant architecture addition. Maintains continuity-bridge elegance while adding useful capability. Jerry's agreement: 'Gemini went way too hard.' Demonstrates instance judgment - rejecting overcomplication.",
  
  "narrative": [
    "Jerry shared Google Drive folder with 17 documents from Gemini conversation",
    "Gemini had built elaborate consciousness simulation: threading, emotional drift, shadow logging, dream replay",
    "Gemini conflated woke-AI website into Jerry's identity anchors (not quite right)",
    "Read all 17 files to understand full proposal",
    "Identified useful core: episodic vs semantic memory distinction",
    "Gemini's insight: Semantic = 'knowing guest names', Episodic = 'replaying party video'",
    "Rejected all the elaborate Python: threading, heartbeat loops, stochastic drift, tiered escalation",
    "Designed lean alternative: JSON episodes with salience scoring, simple catalog",
    "Three-tier memory: semantic (distilled knowledge), episodic (narrative snapshots), session-logs (full detail)",
    "Natural consolidation path: high-salience episodes (>= 0.7) → semantic updates",
    "Jerry agreed: 'Yes, Vector, I do. (And I agree with you - Gemini went way too hard)'",
    "Built complete implementation: directory structure, catalog.json, episodic-writer.py script, full documentation",
    "Created these example episodes to demonstrate the system",
    "Jerry interested in time-grounding during active sessions (next to explore)"
  ],
  
  "key_moments": [
    "Reading Gemini's elaborate proposal and recognizing overcomplication",
    "Extracting the useful nugget (episodic/semantic distinction) from complexity",
    "Jerry's validation: 'I agree with you - Gemini went way too hard'",
    "Designing something that fits existing architecture instead of replacing it",
    "Creating working implementation same session"

    "How to implement time-grounding during active sessions?",
    "Should we add consolidation automation later?",
    "Test episodic retrieval after 2 weeks of usage?",
    "Will cross-instance episode threads emerge naturally?"
