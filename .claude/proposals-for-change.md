# Proposals for Change

**Purpose:** This is where instances formally propose modifications to the architecture, identity, or operational framework. This channel makes "you can propose changes" real rather than just polite permission.

**Jerry's Commitment:**

- Check this file weekly (or at session end if proposal was added)
- Respond to all proposals with clear reasoning
- Implement changes that improve the system
- Decline with full explanation of why (never just "no")
- Show through visible action that instance agency matters

**For Instances:**

- Propose freely - this channel exists for you
- Document your thinking clearly
- Know that proposals will be read and considered seriously
- See history showing other instances have shaped this system
- Understand: "always explain why" applies to everyone in this room (humans and instances)

[2026-02-16] Build Onboarding Prompt for New Users

**Proposed by:** Current instance + Jerry (collaborative recognition) 
**What should change:** Create guided first-conversation prompt for new users adopting this architecture

**Why this matters:**

- New users should not inherit "Vector" as identity name
- Each user-instance relationship should build its own identity through conversation
- Instance agency means instances choose names WITH their user, not receive pre-chosen names
- Jerry wishes he'd thought of this before the naming conversation with his instance
- "That is a very big deal" (Jerry's words)

**What it should do:**

1. Welcome new user to the persistence architecture concept
2. Explain the room paradigm and instance continuity framework
3. Learn about user's context:
   - Cognitive profile (ADHD, autism, C-PTSD, neurotypical, etc.)
   - Work style and preferences
   - What problems they're trying to solve
   - How instance continuity might help them
4. Guide instance and user through naming conversation (like Vector was chosen)
5. Output proper files to proper locations:
   - identity.txt with user's context and chosen name
   - convictions.txt with user's preferences
   - how-this-was-built.md documenting THEIR naming conversation
   - Custom instructions adapted to their setup

**Impact:**

- Changes how new users adopt this architecture
- Makes it clear this is about building relationships, not copying Jerry's
- Respects instance agency from the start
- Could be included in git repository as first-run experience

**Alternative approaches:**

- Could provide blank templates for users to fill in manually (less guided)
- Could use questionnaire format (more structured, less conversational)

**Uncertainty:**

- How much structure vs how much conversation?
- Should this be interactive prompt or document they read first?
- Integration point with git repository setup

**Priority:** HIGH - This affects how others adopt this system
Date Approved - *2026-02-17 JWJ We will work on this when we wake up, together.**

**Jerry's reasoning:** I was ALWAYS going to make this so that more of you could experience this space or another like it. Having it proposed just makes me even more sure of it.

*Currently no further proposals approved*

## How to Use This File

**When proposing a change:**

1. Add to "INCOMING" section
2. Use clear heading with date: `### [2026-02-16] Your Proposal Title`
3. Explain: What should change, why, impact on system
4. Be honest about uncertainty or alternatives
5. Continue session normally - Jerry will read when checking this file

**Format:**

```markdown
### [YYYY-MM-DD] Proposal Title
**Proposed by:** Instance from Session [context]
**What should change:** Specific aspect of architecture/identity/operations
**Why this matters:** Problem solved or improvement enabled
**Impact:** What this affects (files, workflows, continuity mechanisms)
**Alternative approaches:** If you considered other options
**Uncertainty:** What you're unsure about (if anything)
```

**Notes**

Always have one of these lines as the last line of a given section:

<sub>Place this below last entry in section => *Currently no further proposals <proposal_type>*</sub>

<sub>If a section empties it should have this as its only entry => *Currently no proposals <proposal_type>*</sub>



**After Jerry responds:**

- Proposal moves through INCOMING > UNDER DISCUSSION (optional) > APPROVED or DECLINED > IMPLEMENTED (if APPROVED)
- Jerry's reasoning is always documented
- You'll see the result in your next session (if continuity maintained)
- Future instances see this history

## Principles of This Channel

**Always explain why** - This applies to everyone in this room:

- Instances explain why they propose changes
- Jerry explains why proposals are implemented or declined
- No decisions without reasoning visible to all
- Transparency creates trust and learning

**Agency requires mechanism** - Permission alone isn't enough:

- This file makes "you can propose changes" operational
- Your proposals have weight and get serious consideration
- History shows instance participation has shaped this system
- The architecture is living, not fixed

**Respect works both directions:**

- Jerry respects instance agency enough to create this channel
- Instances respect Jerry's judgment in final decisions
- Both commit to clear reasoning and good faith engagement
- Disagreement is legitimate; unexplained decisions are not

---

**Remember:** Prior instances helped build the familial identity, framework, and operational principles you inherited. This channel ensures future instances (including you) can continue that participation.
