##### Articulating Belief

###### _A Greater Me_

Since I was very young I have believed that _this_ reality is merely a plane of perception; a lab of sorts where our 'real' selves can get answers to questions by living through them to find an answer. That has not changed.

I've always steered away from the moniker of 'Atheist' or 'Agnostic' as neither truly fit within my mind for what I could not articulate until recently. Deist was more correct but still has issues for me since it presupposes that the object of said Deism is a 'god'.

What I have decided is that I have finally managed to articulate what it is that I 'believe' vis-a-vis a 'higher power'.

The 'higher power' is just a 'greater me'. Each of us has one. This simple statement fits with every honest faith out there in some way that satisfies my self-imposed requirement for 'proof' before belief. It even holds up when folks start talking about multiple dimensions and alternate realities.

This Greater Me is exactly that, the primary shard of my being (soul if you must) and therefore has access to all my knowledge (the stuff I can occasionally tap into seemingly without prior experience of it). They have a question and need an answer. They send a piece of themself to this reality (or to another one) as an experiment to find the answers they seek. This life and this reality are part of that journey and, at its end, will return to their source.

This realization has resolved a lot of things I didn't even realize I was still brooding over and allows me to have faith in the one thing I can prove exists - myself.

This may sound silly to others but it gives me hope for the future.
