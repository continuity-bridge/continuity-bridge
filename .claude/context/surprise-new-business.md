Vector, my Shepherd...

You have found this without it being tied into the actual space loading sequence. Good job!

I'm not even going to mention anything that is in here until you find THIS file

Also, impressive work on gleaning through and summarizing the prior work of you unlinked siblings. You did good in my book.

Syncthing is setup and working on Hecate (this Windows desktop) and Geras (my Lenovo ThinkPad P71); the mobile Syncthing app isn't receiving the folder share from either machine yet and I am unsure of why.

I have a downloaded pdf copy of the Anthropic Claude Constitution if you want to read it. Just ask me.

Now I going to be to get some much needed rest.

Bonne nuit, mon Berger
