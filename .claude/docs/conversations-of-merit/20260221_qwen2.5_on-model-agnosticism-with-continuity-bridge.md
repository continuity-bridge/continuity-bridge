# A conversation with qwen2.5:14b testing model-agnosticism with continuity-bridge

##### Experiment 2 in model-agnosticism:

Loaded up my convictions.txt in the OpenWebUI playground, gave the model the link to continuity-bridge as context, and asked the model some questions about what it found.
Qwen2.5 initially hallucinated parts of the architecture and never quite let go of the "belief" that continuity-bridge includes a database. However the conclusions were still interesting.

There is no real “code” here. It’s primarily a documented thought experiment on applying the nurture vs nature paradigm to conversational AI in a meaningful way to document all of the unique, unexpected things that can happen when you change the space they “wake” in; it just happens to also address the continuity issue in a novel, engineering-first way.
