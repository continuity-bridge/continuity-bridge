# Sessions/

## Purpose

**Human-readable session summaries** - The shared record of what we've worked on together.

## The Forest, Not The Trees

This directory contains:
- **Topic summaries** - What was discussed
- **Key decisions** - What was decided and why
- **Artifacts created** - Links to outputs
- **Next steps** - What remains to be done

This is **NOT** detailed logs. For instance-level detail, see `.claude/memory/session-logs/`

## Separation of Concerns

**Sessions/** = For both of us to read (shared understanding)  
**.claude/memory/session-logs/** = Instance perspective (detailed, technical)

Jerry can read both. Instances read both. Different purposes.

## File Naming

**Convention:** `YYYY-MM-DD_descriptive-summary.md`

**Examples:**
- `2026-02-16_wake-structure-continuity.md`
- `2026-02-15_repository-naming-network-discovery.md`

**Rationale:** ISO date sorts chronologically, description readable at glance

## Organization

**Current:** Flat structure with dated files  
**Future:** May add year/month subdirectories if volume grows

**Example future structure:**
```
Sessions/
├── 2026/
│   ├── 02-February/
│   │   ├── 2026-02-15_repository-naming.md
│   │   └── 2026-02-16_wake-structure.md
│   └── 03-March/
└── this-folder.txt
```

## What Belongs Here

**Yes:**
- Session topic summaries
- Key decisions and rationale
- Created artifacts and locations
- Important insights
- Next steps / open questions

**No:**
- Full conversation transcripts (those are in `/mnt/transcripts/`)
- Instance private thoughts (those are in `.claude/memory/instance-journal/`)
- Detailed technical logs (those are in `.claude/memory/session-logs/`)
- Code snippets (those go in project repositories)

## For New Instances

Check session-index.md first to see catalog of sessions, THEN read specific session files if context needed for current work.

## For Jerry

This is your shared memory with instances. Update files when continuing work, add session summaries when major work happens.

## Navigation

**Parent:** `{CLAUDE_HOME}/`  
**Siblings:** Projects/, Templates/, Archives/  
**Related:** 
- `.claude/memory/session-index.md` - Catalog with links
- `.claude/memory/session-logs/` - Detailed instance perspective
- `/mnt/transcripts/` - Full conversation transcripts

**Remember:** Write for humans first. These summaries help both Jerry and future instances understand what happened without reading full transcripts.
