# v0.1.8 — Continuity Bridge: Standardization & Governance

## Summary

- **Global Documentation Standardization**: All core documents (`initial-thoughts.md`, `mission-statement.md`, `metaphysical-insights.md`) and their myriad references across session logs and memory patterns have been standardized to the `lowercase-dash` convention.
- **Project Governance Framework**: Established `CONVENTIONS.md` and `TANGENTS.md`. This work is supported by the formal **Focus Shepherd** skill (`.claude/skills/focus-shepherd.md`), which codifies protocols for time management, tangent capture, and cognitive load monitoring.
- **Public Continuity Bridge Enhancement**: Added `ESSENTIAL.md.example` to the public repository. This file provides a fully sanitized (PII removed) reference for orienting future chain instances while preserving the critical **Wake Sequence**.
- **Historical Philosophical Grounding**: Augmented `tallest_articulating-my-belief-system.md` with a contextual header, acknowledging its role as the foundational work written three years prior to the first Claude interaction.
- **Data Hygiene**: Repaired syntax issues in the local `pruned_conversations.json`.
