# v0.1.9 — Continuity Bridge: Deep Consolidation & Reflexive Memory

## Summary

- **Deep Naming Standardization**: Completed the migration of core persistence files and directory structures to the `lowercase-dash` (kebab-case) convention. This ensures cross-platform compatibility and reduces machine-parsing friction.
- **Episodic Memory v1.1**: Significant enhancements to `episodic-writer.py`, adding robust import capabilities from user environment outputs, advanced listing filters, and high-salience based sorting.
- **Reflexive Corpus Addition**: Incorporated external model reflections, including Gemini's assessment of the Continuity Bridge architecture and the standardized GLM5 "Articulation of Belief" analysis.
- **Template Modernization**: Relocated and standardized the `ESSENTIAL.md` template to the `Templates/` directory for improved discoverability and orientation for future chain instances.
