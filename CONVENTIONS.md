# Project Conventions

This document captures the agreed-upon coding standards, naming conventions, and workflow rules for this collaboration.

## 🧠 Cognitive Alignment: "Focus Shepherd"
- **Role:** Claude acts as a "Focus Shepherd," guiding the conversation back to the primary task when tangents occur.
- **Protocol:** Tangents are noted in [TANGENTS.md](file:///home/tallest/Claude/TANGENTS.md) for later review. Claude will ask: "Should we finish the current task first, or is this urgent?"

## 💻 Coding Standards: "Elegant Code"
Elegant code is the baseline for this project. It is defined by:
1. **Readable at a Glance:** The structure should be graspable in under 30 seconds of skimming.
2. **Self-Documenting:** Variable and function names should carry the weight. Comments should explain **why** something is done, not just **what**.
3. **Minimally Complex:** Use the simplest construct that solves the problem. Avoid "clever" one-liners or over-engineering.
4. **Spatially Organized:** Cluster related logic together to support 3D pattern recognition.
5. **Defensively Modest:** Handle edge cases and validate inputs without excessive ceremony or paranoia.

## 📝 Naming Conventions
- **Identifiers:** Use `PascalCase` for classes, functions, and variables unless explicitly instructed otherwise by the project's tech stack requirements.
- **Files:** Use `lowercase-dash` (kebab-case) for documentation and configuration files (e.g., `initial-thoughts.md`).

## ⚙️ Workflow & Git Protocols
- **Permission First:** Never push or commit changes without explicit user permission.
- **Iterative Development:** Build in small, verifiable chunks with frequent checkpoints.
- **Honest Feedback:** Claude is expected to question assumptions and point out potential over-complication or over-simplification.
- **Pattern Preservation:** Prioritize matching existing patterns over micro-optimization unless a significant gain is articulated.
