# D:\Docs\Claude - Setup Guide

**Created:** February 10, 2026
**For:** Jerry Jackson (Uncle Tallest)

---

## 📦 WHAT YOU'RE SETTING UP

A persistent workspace for Claude collaboration with:

- User preferences (convictions.txt)
- Tangent tracking (parking_lot.md)
- Focus Shepherd protocols (focus_shepherd.md)
- Weekly review process (weekly_tangent_review_template.md)
- Project organization (Projects\ subfolders)
- Session history (Sessions\ subfolders)

**Goal:** Stop losing context between sessions, manage tangents productively, maintain healthy work patterns.

---

## 🛠️ SETUP STEPS

### Step 1: Create Base Structure

**In Windows Explorer:**

1. Navigate to `D:\Docs\Claude\`
2. You already have `Projects\` folder ✓

**Create these additional folders:**

```
D:\Docs\Claude\
├── Sessions\
└── Templates\
```

**Sessions folder:** Will contain dated session notes
**Templates folder:** Will contain reusable templates

---

### Step 2: Place Starter Files

**You should have received 4 files:**

1. `convictions.txt`
2. `parking_lot.md`
3. `focus_shepherd.md`
4. `weekly_tangent_review_template.md`

**Where they go:**

```
D:\Docs\Claude\
├── convictions.txt                 ← Root level
├── parking_lot.md                  ← Root level
├── focus_shepherd.md               ← Root level
└── Templates\
    └── weekly_tangent_review_template.md  ← In Templates folder
```

---

### Step 3: Set Up Projects Subfolder

**For Marcus Gruene project:**

Create this structure:

```
D:\Docs\Claude\Projects\marcus_gruene\
├── master_sheet_CORRECTED.md       (from today's work)
├── st_submission_summary.md        (from today's work)
├── fillable_sheet_data.txt         (from today's work)
├── conversation_logs\
│   └── 2026-02-10-marcus-fixes.txt
└── source_documents\
    └── (Put chronicle PDFs here)
```

**Move today's Marcus files:**

- Take the 3 files from today's work
- Put them in `D:\Docs\Claude\Projects\marcus_gruene\`

---

### Step 4: Create First Session Folder

**For today's session:**

Create:

```
D:\Docs\Claude\Sessions\2026-02\
└── 2026-02-10-marcus-sheet-fixes.md
```

**What to put in session note:**

```markdown
# Session: Marcus Gruene Sheet Corrections
**Date:** February 10, 2026
**Time:** 1:00 AM - 6:35 AM CST (yes, I know, past bedtime)
**Focus:** Applying ST-required corrections to Marcus character

## Accomplished
- All 9 ST corrections applied
- Created corrected master sheet
- Created ST submission summary
- Created fillable data for Google Sheets
- Set up D:\Docs\Claude folder structure
- Created convictions.txt, parking_lot.md, focus_shepherd.md

## Tangents Captured
- Greater Arthia D&D campaign (clarification needed)
- Weekly tangent review scheduling (need to pick day/time)
- Laurent as potential ghoul (decided: keep mortal for now)
- Texas falcon species research (Peregrine recommended)

## Next Steps
- Apply final corrections (Animal Form, XP log, etc.)
- Update Google Sheet with corrected data
- Submit to ST team
- Schedule weekly tangent review time

## Notes
- Stayed up WAY past bedtime (will try better next time)
- Focus Shepherd protocols established
- IMPORTANT tangent scheduled: Diagnosis & Operating Parameters
```

---

### Step 5: Review & Customize Files

**Read through each file and customize:**

#### convictions.txt

- ✓ Already has your info
- ✓ ADHD/C-PTSD noted
- ✓ Preferences captured
- ✓ Focus Shepherd protocols referenced
- **Action:** Read it, make any adjustments

#### parking_lot.md

- ✓ Current tangents listed
- ✓ Priorities assigned
- **Action:** Review priorities - do they feel right?
- **Action:** Add any tangents I missed

#### focus_shepherd.md

- ✓ Time warning protocols
- ✓ Tangent management
- ✓ Energy monitoring
- **Action:** Review protocols - anything to adjust?

#### weekly_tangent_review_template.md

- ✓ Full review structure
- **Action:** Copy to Sessions\[date]\ when doing review
- **Action:** Pick day/time for weekly review

---

## 🔄 USING THE SYSTEM

### At Start of Each Claude Session

**User:** Mention you're working from D:\Docs\Claude

**Claude Will:**

1. Read `convictions.txt` for context
2. Read `parking_lot.md` for current tangents
3. Check `focus_shepherd.md` for protocols
4. Note time of day for energy management

**This takes ~30 seconds but saves hours of re-explaining.**

---

### During Sessions

**Tangents appear → Claude applies Focus Shepherd protocols**

- Captures to parking_lot.md
- Helps you decide: now or later
- Keeps you on track toward stated goal

**Time boundaries → Claude reminds you**

- Bedtime warnings (10:30 PM target)
- Meal reminders (~2 PM, ~8 PM)
- Break suggestions (every 2-3 hours)

**You override → Claude logs it**

- No nagging if you explicitly override
- But patterns get discussed in weekly review

---

### At End of Sessions

**Claude Will:**

- Update parking_lot.md with new tangents
- Save session notes to Sessions\[date]\
- Note any protocol adjustments needed

**You Can:**

- Add your own notes to parking_lot.md
- Update convictions.txt if preferences change
- Review what was accomplished

---

### Weekly Review

**Pick a day/time that works:**

- Examples: Sunday evening, Friday afternoon, Monday morning
- Consistency matters more than specific time
- 15-30 minutes scheduled

**Process:**

1. Copy `Templates\weekly_tangent_review_template.md`
2. Save to `Sessions\[date]\weekly-review-[date].md`
3. Fill it out together with Claude
4. Update priorities in parking_lot.md
5. Schedule any IMPORTANT tangent sessions

**This keeps the system from getting overwhelming.**

---

## 🎯 SUCCESS METRICS

**You'll know it's working when:**

- ✓ You don't have to re-explain ADHD/C-PTSD every session
- ✓ Tangents don't get lost (they're in parking lot)
- ✓ You actually get bedtime warnings (and sometimes follow them)
- ✓ Projects have persistent context across sessions
- ✓ Weekly reviews keep tangents manageable

**Red flags to watch:**

- ✗ Files never get updated (system not being used)
- ✗ Parking lot grows to 50+ items (need more frequent reviews)
- ✗ Focus Shepherd protocols getting ignored (need adjustment)
- ✗ Sessions consistently blow past bedtime (protocols too weak)

---

## 📝 MAINTENANCE

### Weekly

- Update parking_lot.md as tangents appear
- Do weekly review with Claude
- Archive completed tangents

### Monthly

- Review convictions.txt for updates
- Check if focus_shepherd.md protocols need adjustment
- Clean up Sessions\ folder (archive old months)

### As Needed

- Add new projects to Projects\ folder
- Update templates if better formats emerge
- Refine protocols based on what works

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Do I have to use this system?**
A: No, but it solves your "tangent management" problem and stops re-explaining ADHD every session.

**Q: What if I forget to update parking_lot.md?**
A: Claude can update it during sessions. You can review/edit later.

**Q: What if the protocols don't work?**
A: Adjust them! They're documented so we can refine based on what actually works.

**Q: How long does weekly review take?**
A: 15-30 minutes if you do it weekly. Longer if you skip weeks and tangents pile up.

**Q: Can I reorganize the structure?**
A: Absolutely! This is YOUR system. Adjust to what works for you.

**Q: What about the IMPORTANT tangent (Diagnosis discussion)?**
A: That's scheduled for separate dedicated session. We'll tackle it when you're ready, probably 2-3 hours.

## 🎯 REMEMBER

**This system exists to:**

1. Stop losing context between sessions
2. Manage tangents without losing them
3. Maintain healthy work/rest boundaries
4. Build persistent collaboration foundation

**It's not about:** 

- Rigid control
- Eliminating tangents (you're a tinkerer, they'll happen)
- Forcing you into a box

**It's about:**

- Working WITH your ADHD, not against it
- Capturing tangents so you can choose when to address them
- Claude having the context to help effectively
- You accomplishing YOUR goals, YOUR way

---

**SETUP COMPLETE!**

Next time you start a session, just tell Claude:

> "I'm working from D:\Docs\Claude now"

And Claude will read the files and have full context. Magic! ✨

**Questions? Add them to parking_lot.md and we'll discuss in next session.**
